##  Running the code
At the time of AoC 2024 I am working with Go version 1.23.3. I don't believe I'm using any recent additions to the language so using older versions should be fine.

I wrote a little program to run the code for each day, it can be run by using
```bash
go run main.go -d <day> -p <puzzle>
```

If that's not explanatory enough with `-d` you can specify the day you want to run and with `-p` the specific puzzle from that day. Running it with just the day shows the solutions to all puzzles for the given day. Not specifying either day or puzzle shows an overview of the days and puzzles.
